Getting Started
===============

Research Gateway is a cloud-based solution that makes it possible for researchers and other consumers of High Performance Computing to easily access resources in the AWS cloud.
RLCatalyst Research Gateway is designed for simplicity and you can get started very quickly. 
You can access this product either as a `hosted Silo model`_ or as a hosted Shared model.

.. _hosted Silo model: https://relevancelab.com/2021/02/11/8-steps-to-set-up-rlcatalyst-research-gateway/

If you are using the hosted Silo model, you will be provided a public URL to which you can navigate using your browser. 
You will also be provided with the credentials for the Administrator user.

If you are using the hostel Shared model, you can sign up with your details. Use details from :ref:`Sign-Up <Sign-Up process>` to create a new user.

Secure connections to resources using ALB to RStudio and Nextflow-Advanced Products 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Research Gateway can set up secure connections to your resources by putting them behind an Application Load Balancer with SSL connections using certificates managed by AWS Certificate Manager.
2. When creating an account if you select the “Use SSL with ALB” check box it will create ALB. An ALB will incur costs irrespective of traffic passing through it. 
   Note: Refer :ref:`Adding AWS Accounts <Adding AWS Accounts>` for account creation.
   
 .. image:: images/ssl-alb.png 
 
3. Once project creation is successful you can see the status about certificates and load balancer, target groups, listener, etc.. on the events page.
   Note: Refer :ref:`Adding a new project <Adding a new project>` for project creation.
4. Navigate to the available products panel and launch Nextflow-Advanced with required parameters. Once the product is provisioned you can see the outputs through the “View Outputs”. You can monitor the pipeline through “Monitor Pipeline”.

.. image:: images/actions-nf.png 

5. Navigate to the available products panel and launch RStudio with the required parameters. Once the product is provisioned you can connect to RStudio through the “Open link” action.

Click on the “Create Project” button. Added a new project successfully.

**Note**: While creation of project, if you select "Standard Catalog" option it will create 6 products(Amazon Sagemaker, Amazon S3, Amazon EC2-Linux, Amazon EC2-Windows, RStudio and Nextflow-Advanced). If you select "Bring your own catalog" option it will pull all the products in the portfolio of the AWS account.

Project Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Research Gateway will set up a shared S3 bucket(Project Storage) where the team members can store data. This shared storage will be mounted into all supported workspaces. Storage costs will be accounted for at the project level. For a lot of scientific research, data is stored in file format (e.g. fasta, fastq files for Genomics research). The natural choice for storage of this data could be S3 (inexpensive, highly elastic) or Elastic Block Storage (access is extremely fast). As part of project creation we are creating project storage(i.e., S3 Bucket) and sharing with users.

1. The Project level storage will be listed as a product in the My Products tab inside the project as an S3 bucket. There is explore action inside the S3 bucket<<There is a folder called “Shared”.
   Note: It is a common folder(only accessible by user unless shared)  and it  is available to all users.

.. image:: images/projectstorage.png   

.. image:: images/shared.png  

2. You can able to view, upload and delete objects in the storage.
3. While launching any EC2 based product, the user will be prompted whether to mount the Project and User level storage.
4. The Storage will be mounted as a specific folder inside the EC2 machine which the user can use to perform any tasks on. Any data written to the folder will be synced back to the storage and will be accessible to the user on exploring.


Initially project is in creating state. Once project creation completed the status will be changed to "Active". Click on the project in **"My Projects"** list. 

.. image:: images/myprojects.png 


Once you click on the project, you can see the budget in the cards and remaining details will show a tabbed area with the following tabs:
   1. Project Details
   2. Events
   3. Available Products
   4. My Products

Project Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. You can view the project details here. If the project is in a failed state, you can repair the project through the “Repair” option. 
2. You can see the project-related events in the “Events” tab.
3. Click on the “Pause” action which is available on the right side. When you click on "Pause" action,  all the researchers under this project would be affected. In a Paused state new provisioning is not allowed. Users can continue to use already provisioned resources as before. All the available products would be visible but the “Launch Now “ button would be hidden.
4. Click on the “Resume” button which is available on the right side. The project status changed to “Active”. In the Active state, team members can launch new products from the catalog of Available Products.
5. Click on the “Stop” button which is available on the right side. In a Stopped state, all underlying resources will be stopped and the user will not be able to perform actions on them but you are able to terminate the product. You need to manually start the resources except for the s3 product.
6. Click on the “Sync” button which is available on the right side. It should sync the catalog. You can see related events in the events tab.

**Note**:

a. When adding a project we are passing collaborators information. Through this, we are linking collaborators to the project. 
b. The project is independent of the researcher. We can create an empty project and add researchers later. Once project is active, we can add researchers through the "Manage" option which is at the project details screen.

*My Projects* page of the Research Gateway lists all the existing projects created along with other details. Clicking on a specific project shall leads to a project details page.
